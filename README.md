# AirQualityAnalysis



In this data-driven project, we aim to analyze air quality data using various regression models to gain insights and predictions on air pollution levels. The project leverages the power of Streamlit, a user-friendly Python library for creating interactive web applications, to present our findings and model performances in an easily accessible and intuitive manner.

Key Regression Models Utilized:

Multiple Linear Regression: We employ this fundamental regression technique to explore the relationship between multiple independent variables and the air quality target variable. This helps us understand how different factors impact air pollution levels.

Polynomial Regression: By introducing polynomial terms into the regression model, we aim to capture nonlinear relationships between the predictors and the air quality response. This allows for more flexible and accurate modeling.

Decision Tree Regression: Decision trees enable us to split the data based on specific conditions, creating a tree-like model. We can harness the power of decision tree regression to predict air quality values based on the input features.

Random Forest Regression: As an ensemble learning method, Random Forest combines multiple decision trees to produce more robust and accurate predictions. We utilize this technique to achieve improved predictive performance.

Support Vector Regression (SVR): SVR is a powerful regression method used to model nonlinear relationships. We employ SVR to capture complex patterns in air quality data, resulting in accurate predictions.

Streamlit Application:
The project culminates in the creation of an interactive Streamlit web application. The application offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to explore the air quality analysis results effortlessly. Through intuitive visualizations, users can gain insights into how different factors impact air pollution and interact with the regression models to predict air quality levels under various scenarios.

Project Goals:

Analyze air quality data to identify trends, patterns, and potential contributing factors affecting air pollution levels.
Develop and train various regression models to predict air quality values based on relevant features.
Evaluate the performance of each regression model and select the most suitable one for accurate predictions.
Create an interactive web application using Streamlit to present the project's findings and allow users to explore the analysis and predictions.
Provide actionable insights to stakeholders and the public to better understand air quality dynamics and potential mitigation strategies.
By leveraging regression models and Streamlit, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of air quality dynamics and enhance decision-making processes for policymakers, environmentalists, and the general public. The accessible web application empowers users to engage with the data-driven insights, fostering awareness and informed actions towards improving air quality and safeguarding the environment.
